## Why this repo?

I'm making this repo to store my solutions to the various interesting problems LeetCode tries to throw at me. It shall have multiple languages[^1] from your good old `C` to your `JavaScript`. This is definitely the repo to watch out for in 2024.

# MORE DOCUMENTATION COMING SOON! :laughing:
